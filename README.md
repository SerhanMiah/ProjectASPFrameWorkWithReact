## Phase

A solo project where I used ASP.NET Core with React to create an E-commerce App. This project demonstrates how to build a functional web application using C# and ASP.NET Core for the backend and React for the frontend. The app includes essential features like user authentication, product listing, shopping cart, order management, and checkout process.

The E-commerce App is built using the following key components:

Product Model: This class represents the product entity, including its name, description, price, image URL, and category.

ApplicationDbContext: This class inherits from DbContext and includes DbSet properties for the product and other related models. It manages database operations and connections.

ProductController: This class is responsible for handling API requests related to products. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products.

ProductService: This service class handles product-related business logic and communicates with the ApplicationDbContext to perform database operations.

ShoppingCart Model: This class represents the shopping cart entity, including its items, quantities, and total price.

Order Model: This class represents the order entity, including customer information, order items, and order status.

React Components: The frontend is built using React components that interact with the backend API to display products, manage the shopping cart, process orders, and handle user authentication.
